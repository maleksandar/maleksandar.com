I am a software engineer specialized in frontend technologies. I’m currently on master studies at the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Belgrade.

I worked mostly in software engineering companies that were service oriented, therefore I developed software for many different clients and business areas such as insurance, major sports organizations, banks, heavy machine building industry, and many more. Also, I worked as a full stack web developer in .NET, so developing and designing REST APIs are not the things that are unknown to me.

Currently, I work as a senior UI engineer at Grid Dynamics in Belgrade.

About this site:
I’m not religious about technology choices, but I do have opinions and preferences. Sometimes I enjoy discussing them, at other times I will refer you towards a blog post online that supports my views about the issue. Hopefully, over time, most of those references will lead you to this site.

Besides occasional blog posts, I will use this site to maintain my CV in the format that is for me easiest to maintain.

Quite frankly, I actually started working on this site because I hate updating my CV. Using some generic word template looks way too cheap, and using Latex to generate some nice PDF is just too painful for me.
